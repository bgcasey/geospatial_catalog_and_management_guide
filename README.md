# Spatial Data Catalog and Management Guide
![In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Development-yellow)

A spatial data catalog and data management guide. 

for sourcing, organizing, and extracting spatial covariates. View a working list of predictor variables [here](https://github.com/bgcasey/spatial_data_catalog/blob/main/predictor_variable_list.csv).

The catalog documents all spatial data that has been pre-processed for the ABMI Science Centre. The catalog includes metadata, the relative path to the data on the Science Centre's internal server, and links to preprocessing scripts. 

This is a sibling repository to the Science Centre's [Geospatial Preprocessing and Extraction Toolkit](https://github.com/bgcasey/geospatial_preprocessing_and_extraction_toolkit).
The toolkit contains genalized preprossing scripts, Google Earth Engine functions, and a vignette for summarizing spatial data to points and polygons using R.

## 3. Data Storage

Once downloaded, data should be stored in a spatial data directory with folders organized by data thematic type. The script [create_spatial_data_dir.py](scripts/create_spatial_data_dir.py) can be used to create an empty directory. Each spatial dataset should be stored in a subfolder stored within the corresponding thematic folder. Thematic folders are based on [ISO 19115 Topic Categories](https://nap.geogratis.gc.ca/metadata/register/registerItems-eng.html#RI_653).

## 4. Metadata Standards

Spatial data folders should include all data and metadata necessary to ensure efficient and reproducible workflows.

| **Item**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

All spatial data should include a `readme.txt` file with metadata that complies with the **[North American Profile (NAP) of the ISO 19115: Geographic Information – Metadata Standard](https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/incits-l1-standards-projects/NAP-Metadata)**. Metadata should include:


- **Title**: Clear and descriptive name.
- **Abstract**: Concise summary of the dataset's purpose, content, and scope.
- **Spatial Extent**: Bounding coordinates.
- **Temporal Extent**: Timeframe of data (e.g., 2010–2020 or "Ongoing").
- **Spatial and Temporal Resolution**: The granularity of the data (e.g., "30m resolution, monthly intervals").
- **Lineage**: Origin, processing history, and data sources.
- **Access and Use Constraints**: Licensing, usage rights, and restrictions.

See the [Spatial Metadata Template](spatial_metadata_template.txt) for more information.

## 5. Spatial Data Storage and Extraction Workflow

The workflow begins with sourceing biologically relevent spatial data determining if it needs to be manaully derived using Google Earth Engine (GEE). If yes, preprocessing is done using GEE. Once preprocessed the spatial data is exported to a personal Google Drive folder, and subsequently stored in a temporary folder for further preprocessing. Non-GEE data is assessed to check if preprocessing is required. If preprocessing is necessary, the data is also stored in the temporary folder and processed. Once ready, preprocessed data is stored within a subdirectory of the thematic folder corresponding to its topic category (e.g. biota, elevation, or inlandWaters). Along with the spatial data, a metadata file documenting the preprocessing steps is within the same directory. Finally, the processed data is extracted to specific points for further analysis.
